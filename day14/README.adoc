== Day 12

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths

=== Idea

The idea for part one is to simply calculate the modulo of arrival time and the
bus ID. The waiting time is the bus id minus the moduli. The smallest value is the solution.

I needed some googling to find out that the Chinese Remainder Theorem can be used to solve this puzzle. After that I reread the section in this book http://weitz.de/KMFI/ to beeing able to implement it. 

=== What I learned

Got reminded of the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day13.py --help`
