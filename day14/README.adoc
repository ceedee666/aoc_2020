== Day 14

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths
* functools for the `reduce` function

=== Idea

The idea for part one was simply to convert the integers to binary and apply the mask.
the f-strings in python a pretty helpful for this.

Part two is straight forward with the solution of part one.

=== What I learned

There are quite helpful formatting options in f-strings.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day14 --help`
