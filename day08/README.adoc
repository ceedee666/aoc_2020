== Day 05

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths
* collections to use the defaultdict

=== Idea

Oh no. Int-Code-Computer all over again. 
No special idea for part 1. Just a straight forward implementation using a while loop.

=== What I learned


=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day08.py --help`
