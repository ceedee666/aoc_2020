== Day 05

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths
* collections to use the defaultdict

=== Idea

The main idea today is to use `dict`s to represent which bags are contained in
which other bags. I created two dicts. One to represent which bags contain which other bags. 
And one to represent the reverse relation.

I used two recursive functions to solve the two parts of the puzzle.
=== What I learned

I use some list comprehension in this solution. Unfortunately, this time my solution is much more
imperative then on the previous days. One of my goals is to practice some functional programming 
but this didn't work that well today. Seems I need more practice :D

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day07.py --help`
