== Day 05

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths
* functools for the reduce function

=== Idea

The main idea today is to use sets. The first part can be solved using
the union operation for sets, the second using the intersection operation.

=== What I learned

I learned that the set operation in python like `union` and `intersection`
can take a iterable as input. Together with the `*` operator this enable calling 
these functions e.g. with a list of sets.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day06.py --help`
