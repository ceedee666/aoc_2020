== Day 14

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths
* functools for the `reduce` function

=== Idea

The idea for part one is to convert the rule ranges into a set. This way it is easy to
check if a given value is valid for a rule. After that the `any` function can be used to check
if a value is valid for any rule. 

=== What I learned
