== Day 16

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths
* functools for the `reduce` function

=== Idea

The idea for part one is to convert the rule ranges into a set.
This way it is easy to check if a given value is valid for a rule. 
After that the `any` function can be used to check
if a value is valid for any rule. 

For the second part we now check all values with the same index against 
the rules. If all values are valid for a given rule the index is the
position of the rule on the ticket. 

=== What I learned

This took much longer then expected due to a stupid mistake in my `map` and 
`filter` functions.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day16 --help`
