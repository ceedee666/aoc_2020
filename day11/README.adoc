== Day 11

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths
* the functools library 
* the itertool library
* the collections library

=== Idea

Implement the rules and execute them step by step. 
Very similar to Conways GoL.

=== What I learned

Used a generator function to implement the simulation.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day11.py --help`
