== Day 17

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths

=== Idea

The idea is to convert the expressions into the reverse polish notation
and evalute the result. Due to the missing precedence of the operations
this conversion is simple.
