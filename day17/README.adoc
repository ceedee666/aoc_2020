== Day 17

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths
* functools for the `reduce` function

=== Idea

The example input was really confusing. Therefore I at first though is was wrong. 
After a failed try to only represent the active cells in a dict I simply went for the
3 dimensional list.

For part two I simply added teh 4th dimiension to the code using varius `if` statements.
The code is now quite ugly...

=== What I learned

Don't try to be to clever. Go for the simplest solution first!

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day17 --help`
