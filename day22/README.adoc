== Day 22

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths

=== Idea

Use lists to represnet the decks. Part one was straight forward. Had a little error in the
recursion in part two.

=== What I learned

Recursions are sometimes difficult.

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day22 --help`
