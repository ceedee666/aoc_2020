== Day 21

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths
* functools for the reduce function 

=== Idea

The idea for part one is to use sets to find ingredients that cannot be allergenes.


=== What I learned

* I learned how useful comprehensions are to not only create lists but also sets of dicts.
* Useign mutable sets you can really shot yourself in the foot!

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day21 --help`
