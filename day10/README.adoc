== Day 09

This solution is written in python.

The following libraries are used to implement the solution::
* Typer (https://typer.tiangolo.com/) to generate a nice command line interface
* pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) to work with file paths
* the Counter from the itertools library 

=== Idea

The idea for part one is to::
1. sort the input list 
1. calculate the difference beteween consequtive numbers
1. Count the differences


The idea for part 2 is to count the possible solutions from left to right.

=== What I learned

The `Counter` in the `itertools` library is really useful!

=== How to run

Run using:
`$ python day10.py --help`
